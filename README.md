# hello-world
testing repository creation, branches, commits, pull requests

This is me editing the readme file for the 'non-master' branch, to be merged with the master branch at a later date.
Changes made to the master: you're reading them you buffoon!

1035am: the above changes have now been merged with master. This line is new changes to be saved to the readme-edits branch.
Also, replacing 'idiot' with 'buffoon' above, because (a) buffoon is awesomer, and (b) want to see what deletes look like.
